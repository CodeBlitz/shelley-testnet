# shelley-testnet

Welcome to the dedicated community GitHub repo for support for the the Community repo for the Cardano Shelley testnet program. This is the place to log any issues or bugs that you encounter as you set up and test the self node and stake pools. Please ensure that you are logged into GitHub before you log an issue, so that we can interact with you. 

We will assess all incoming issues in this central location and escalate them appropriately to our development teams for prompt resolution. We plan to provide support on weekdays and we work in different timezones, but 24hr support is not available at this time.

Regular communication is planned and we will be providing copies of our weekly development reports here so that you are kept up to date on what is being delivered and what is planned for the testnet phases.

We encourage you to share your ideas and suggestions in this central location so that we can create a library of resolutions and support for the tasks that you need to perform.
